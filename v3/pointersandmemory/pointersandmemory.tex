\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Memory as a Table}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Lets start with how we will represent memory visually as table.
	\item We can think of the memory allocated to a program as a collection of cells that hold data items. Such as the integer $i = 55$, or the character $c =$'a'.
	\item 
	\begin{tabular}{|c|}
		\hline
		Data\\
		\hline
		0\\
		\hline
		0\\
		\hline
		55\\
		\hline
		0\\
		\hline
		'a'\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Memory as a Table}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item These memory locations are in some physical order. So there is a lowest location and a highest location. We will label them in this order from lowest to highest taking 0 to be the lowest and $n$ to be the highest.
	\item 
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		n &	0\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		4 &	0\\
		\hline
		3 & 55\\
		\hline
		2 & 0\\
		\hline
		1 & 'a'\\
		\hline
		0 & 13\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Memory as a Table}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Finally the stack starts at the highest address and the heap starts at the lowest.
	\item 
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Stack}\\
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		n &	0\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		4 &	0\\
		\hline
		3 & 55\\
		\hline
		2 & 0\\
		\hline
		1 & 'a'\\
		\hline
		0 & 13\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Heap}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\item We will take $n=64$ so we can work with a manageable memory space for the rest of the presentation.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Memory as a Table}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item We will say a row in our table can contain a single variable of any type. So it can contain a single int, char, unsigned long int, etc.

	\item Those of you who are more familiar with C and memory will notice that we are ignoring the size of the type in our table model of memory. If you don't understand this don't be concerned we will go into more detail later.

	\item We will sometimes omit labels such the Stack and Heap to save space on a slide.

	\item This is a fairly precise model of memory in a computer. Each variable or data item is stored in a memory location. That location has an address which is just a index in our table.

	\item It should be noted you will probably never work with memory addresses this small. Most of the addresses you will work with will be large numbers best represented with hexadecimal notation.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointers}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Moving to pointers lets first explain the basic concept.
		\item The basic idea of a pointer is something that tells you where something else is.
		\item Consider Bob. Bob points to McDonalds. 
		\item In effect if you know where Bob is you can look where he is pointing to find McDonalds. \item Then it would be reasonable to call Bob a pointer to McDonalds.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointers}
	Consider our memory table and the variable
	\mint{c}|int i = 49 //located at address 63|

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Stack}\\
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		64 &	0\\
		\hline
		63 &	49\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		0 & 13\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Heap}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}


	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item A pointer in C tells us where a variable or data item is located. To locate $i$ we just need its address 63.
		\item So thats all a pointer is. Just another variable that holds an address (an index to our table).
		\item Since an address is just a number, a pointer is just a number. A pointer to $i$ would have the value 63.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointers}
	\mint{c}|int i = 49 //located at address 63|
	\mint{c}|int *j = 63 //pointer to i, located at address 62|

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Stack}\\
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		64 &	0\\
		\hline
		63 &	49\\
		\hline
		62 &	63\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		0 & 13\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Heap}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}


	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item In this instance $j$ is Bob and $i$ is McDonalds.
		\item Since pointers are also variables they to are stored somewhere in our table.
		\item When we declare them they are statically allocated integers so they are stored on the stack.
		\item $j$ is stored at location 62. It is a pointer to $i$ so its value is the address of $i$ namely 63.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Operations: Address Of (\&)}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Moving to pointer operations lets start with the address of operator (\&).
	\item The address of operator is applicable to any type in C not just pointers. It returns the memory address of the data item you use it on.
	\item
	\mint{c}|int i = 49 //located at address 63|
	\mint{c}|int *j = 63 //pointer to i, located at address 62|
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Stack}\\
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		64 &	0\\
		\hline
		63 &	49\\
		\hline
		62 &	63\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		0 & 13\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}

	\item Given the table from before
	\mint{c}|printf("%d\n", &i); //prints 63|
	\mint{c}|printf("%d\n", &j); //prints 62|
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Operations: Address Of (\&)}
	Since a pointer is just a memory address we can say (\&) returns a pointer to the item you use it on. This allows us to do things like.
	\begin{minted}[frame=lines]{c}
	int i = 49;
	int *j = &i; //j = 63 since index of i is 63
	\end{minted}
	This is a more practical way to get a pointer to a statically declared variable.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Operations: Dereference (*)}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Continuing with pointer operations lets talk about dereference (*).
		\item When you dereference a pointer you are accessing the value at the location specified by the pointer.
		\item
		\mint{c}|int i = 49 //located at address 63|
		\mint{c}|int *j = 63 //pointer to i, located at address 62|
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			\hline
			\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Stack}\\
			\hline
			Address & Data\\
			\hline
			64 &	0\\
			\hline
			63 &	49\\
			\hline
			62 &	63\\
			\hline
			\vdots & \vdots \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}

		\item Considering the table from before and the pointer $j$ which points to $i$ when we dereference $j$ we can essentially replace $*j$ with $i$.

		\begin{minted}[frame=lines]{c}
printf("value at j: %d\n", *j); //prints 49
*j = 69;
printf("value at j: %d\n", *j); //prints 69
		\end{minted}

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Arrays are Pointers}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Continuing our discussion of pointer operations we would like to discuss pointer addition (+), but there are some other topics we must cover first to fully explain it.
	\item The functionality of Arrays is closely related to pointer addition so well explore them first.
	\item Arrays are one of the simplest data structures. They are simply a collection of contiguous memory locations that contain items of the same type.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Arrays are Pointers}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item A statically declared array of integers
	\mint{c}|int A[3] = {4,5,6}|
	would be stored on the stack like so.
	\item \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Stack}\\
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		64 &	0\\
		\hline
		63 &	6\\
		\hline
		62 &	5\\
		\hline
		61 &	4\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\item The variable $A$ would be called the {\it base pointer} of the array, and its value is the address of the first element, in this case address 61.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Arrays are Pointers: Pointer Addition}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item If we dereference $A$ we get the first element namely 4.
		\mint{c}| *A == 4;|
		\item This is equivalent to array indexing using the zero index.
		\mint{c}| *A == A[0]; //both equal 4|
		\item To access more elements we can add to $A$. $A+1$ references the second item at location 62 namely 5. Dereferencing gives us the item at location 62, namely 5.
		\mint{c}| *(A+1) == A[1]; //both equal 5|
		\item So array indexing is really just shorthand for pointer addition + dereference.
		\mint{c}| *(A+i) == A[i];|
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Arrays are Pointers: Pointer Addition}
	Lets go over this again with a code example.
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item \begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int A[3] = {4,5,6};

printf("Val of base pointer A = 0x%x\n", A);
printf("____________________________________");
for(int i=0; i < 3; i++){
	printf("*(A+%d) = %d | ", i, *(A+i));
	printf("A[%d] = %d | ", i, A[i]);
	printf("Address of value at (A+%d) = 0x%x\n", i, (A+i));
}
	\end{minted}
	\item {\bf Output}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
Val of base pointer A = 0x8848ab1c
____________________________________
*(A+0) = 4 | A[0] = 4 | Address of value at (A+0) = 0x8848ab1c
*(A+1) = 5 | A[1] = 5 | Address of value at (A+1) = 0x8848ab20
*(A+2) = 6 | A[2] = 6 | Address of value at (A+2) = 0x8848ab24
\end{minted}
\item Everything does what you would expect it to, except the value of the base pointer increases in increments of 4 instead of 1 each time.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Type System}
To understand why this happens we need to understand a little bit about the type system and the sizes of different types.
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item The atomic unit of memory in C is the {\bf byte} (8 bits). 
	\item Each type in C takes up a certain amount of {\bf bytes} of memory.
	\item Each of the cells in our current table actually correspond to a certain amount of bytes, based on the type stored there.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{The sizeof function }
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item The function {\it sizeof()} takes either a type or variable as an argument.
	\item Given a type {\it sizeof()} returns the size of the type in bytes
	\item Given a variable it returns the size of the type of the variable in bytes. 
	\item It does {\bf not} return the length of an array.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The type system}
Lets look at the size of some types. Please be aware that sizes may be different on different hardware platforms, so these may not be same on your system.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Well check the sizes of types using the code below.
	\item The size of an {\it int} is 4 bytes
	\mint{c}|printf("Size of integer = %lu\n", sizeof(int));|
	\item The size of a {\it char} is 1 byte
	\mint{c}|printf("Size of char = %lu\n", sizeof(char));|
	\item The size of any pointer is 8 bytes, no matter the type it points to.
	\mint{c}|printf("Size of int* = %lu\n", sizeof(int*));|
	\mint{c}|printf("Size of char* = %lu\n", sizeof(char*));|
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Addition (+)}
Now lets look more closely at adding to a pointer with a code example.

\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int* i=0;
int j=0;

printf("Value of Int ptr: 0x%x\n",i);
printf("Value of Int: 0x%x\n",j);

i += 2; //increment ptr
j += 2*sizeof(int); //increment integer

printf("Value of Int ptr: 0x%x\n",i);
printf("Value of Int: 0x%x\n",j);
\end{minted}
{\bf Output}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
Value of Int ptr: 0
Value of Int: 0
Value of Int ptr: 8
Value of Int: 8
\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Addition (+)}
Now lets be clear about how pointer addition is actually defined. If a pointer $i$ is equivalent to a number $j$ then adding to $i$ is equivalent to adding the same thing to $j$ times the size of the type that $i$ points to.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item $int \; j = x, \; x \in \mathbb{N}$
	\item $int* i = j$
	\item $i + 1 \iff j + 1 \cdot sizeof(int)$
	\item More generally $i + x \iff j + x \cdot sizeof(int)$
	\item This is why the array pointer $A$ increased in increments of 4 since the size of the {\bf int} data type is 4.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Addition (+)}
Now that we are no longer ignoring the sizes of types lets take our original table representing the array [3,4,6] and redraw it accurately.
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Stack}\\
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		64 &	0\\
		\hline
		63 &	6\\
		\hline
		62 &	5\\
		\hline
		61 &	4\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\item Each row actually corresponds to 4 bytes for each number in our array so well need 12 cells to represent our 3 numbers.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Addition (+)}
	\mint{c}|int A[3] = {4,5,6}|
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Stack}\\
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		64 &	0\\
		\hline
		63 &	\multirow{4}{*}{6}\\
		62\\
		61\\
		60\\
		\hline
		59 &	\multirow{4}*{5}\\
		58\\
		57\\
		56\\
		\hline
		55 &\multirow{4}*{4}\\
		54\\
		53\\
		52\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Addition (+)}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item The table is almost the same $A$ still equals 1, but what are the implications for addition and dereference.
		\item When you are dereferencing $A$ you are actually referencing the 4 bytes starting at the address of $A$.
		\item When you are adding 1 to $A$ you are actually adding 4, so $A$ points to the next integer in the array.
		\item Lets draw this out in more detail.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Memory Managment} 
Now were going to discuss how we manage memory.
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item We request it from the operating system (allocate it) using
	\mint{c}|void *malloc(size_t size)|
	\item We specify that memory is no longer needed (deallocate) it using
	\mint{c}|void free(void *ptr)|
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Malloc} 
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Beginning with {\it malloc()} lets review its summary from the linux manual pages.
	\item {\it The malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the  allocated memory.} -linux manual pages
	\item Relating it back to our memory table the malloc function accepts a number of bytes as an argument and returns a memory address, (index of our table), to memory on the Heap. 
	\item Consider the table of bytes below, notice we start from the bottom as we now reference the Heap.

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		3&	0\\
		\hline
		2&	6\\
		\hline
		1&	5\\
		\hline
		0 &	4\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Heap}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Malloc} 
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item A call to malloc will return a heap address. We can use it to request memory for an int pointer like so.
	\item \mint{c}|int *i = malloc(sizeof(int));|
	\item \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		3&	0\\
		\hline
		2&	6\\
		\hline
		1&	5\\
		\hline
		0 &	4\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Heap}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\item In this instance malloc may return address 0, so rows 0-3 would be used to store our integer.
	\item Notice the use of the {\it sizeof(int)} to ensure we request the appropriate amount of storage for the type were pointing to. 
	\item The size of these types may vary from hardware to hardware so it is important to use sizeof to keep our code as hardware independent as possible.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Malloc an array} 
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Lets see how we can create our own arrays with malloc using a code example.
	\item \begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int *A = malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);
//store the first 4 multiples of 5
for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) A[i] = 5*i;
// print the elements of A
for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) printf("A[%d] = %d\n", i, A[i]);
	\end{minted}
	\item Were going to modify our table a bit. Its going to index every fourth byte so we can more compactly represent our array in memory.
	\item \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		12&	15\\
		\hline
		8&	10\\
		\hline
		4&	5\\
		\hline
		0 &	0\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Heap}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Free} 
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Dynamic memory allows us to allocate memory programmatically. Say we allocate memory for a new game session every time a new user connects to our server.
	\item But obviously we could have a lot of people connecting to our server, we will eventually run out of memory.
	\item But eventually some users will stop playing and disconnect from our server. So now we should be able to allow someone else to play. We can do this by reusing the memory allocated for the disconnected player for a new session. We can do this with {\it free}
	\item \mint{c}|void free(void *ptr);|
	\item Free is the other half of memory management. Whatever memory you request with malloc you must eventually return with free.
	\item If you fail to free memory you allocate it is called a memory leak. Memory leaks are sources of some mysterious bugs as they can occur at seemingly random (to the programmer) times.
	\item Consider the example of the above gamer server. If it never reclaimed memory it would eventually not allow anyone to play.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Free} 
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Lets go over another programming example allocating memory for a struct pointer and using free appropriately.

	\item \begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\scriptsize]{c}
typedef struct {
    float* vals;
    int length;
} data;

int main(){
    //we can use sizeof like we would for any other data type
    data* D = malloc(sizeof(data));

    //the data is also a pointer so we must allocate memory for it
    D->vals = malloc(sizeof(float) * 5);
    D->length = 5; //we have space for 5 data points

    for (int i = 0; i < D->length; i++) {
        D->vals[i] = 0.25 * (i+1);
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < D->length; i++){
        printf("data point %d: %f\n", i, D->vals[i]);
    }

    //if we fail to free vals before D, then we have created a memory leak.
    free(D->vals);
    free(D);
}
\end{minted}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Thanks for watching}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Hopefully you have gained a solid understanding of pointers and the basics of memory management.
		\item Next we are going put what we've learned into practice by implementing a dynamic data structure in C.
		\item Thanks for watching!
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\iffalse
\begin{frame}{Memory as a Table}
	We can think of memory as a $n$x2 table. The indices of the table are memory addresses (just numbers), and the data at each row is the value stored in that memory location. For now this is a simplified table. We will ignore the relevance of the sizes of data types, and consider each row a single item of type {\it int}.

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		0 & 55 \\
		\hline
		1 & 49 \\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		n & 13\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}

A pointer holds a table index (memory address). So if 49 is stored at location 1 then a pointer to 49 would have the value 1. From this it should be clear that memory addresses are just numbers, so the values of pointers are just numbers. To clarify the value {\bf at} pointers is a different matter, but in C pointers are just 64 bit integers.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Operations: Address Of (\&)}
	Again consider the memory table.

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		0 & 55 \\
		\hline
		1 & 49 \\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		n & 13\\

	Given a data item in our table, the address of (\&) operator gives us the index (memory address) of our data item;

\begin{minted}[frame=lines]{c}
int i = 49; //corresponds to row 1
printf("location of i: %d\n", &i); //prints 1
\end{minted}
In effect {\it \&i} gives us a pointer to {\it i}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Operations: Dereference (*)}
A pointer holds a table index (memory address). When we dereference said pointer we are retrieving the item at that index.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		0 & 55 \\
		\hline
		1 & 43 \\
		\hline
		2 & 8 \\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		n & 13\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines]{c}
//pointer holds index 2
int* i = 2;
//dereferencing (*), and printing value at row 2 <-> 8
printf("value at i: %d\n", *i);
\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Operations: Addition (+)}
Arrays are one of the most basic data structures, they are simply a collection of contiguous memory locations. So all elements are placed one after the other in memory.
\mint{c}|int A[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}|
Arrays are pointers. The value of $A$ is just a memory address. lets say its 113. Then the array corresponds to the following mem table.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Address & Data\\
		\hline
		0 & 55 \\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		\hline
		113 & 1\\
		\hline
		114 & 2 \\
		\hline
		115 & 3 \\
		\hline
		116 & 4 \\
		\hline
		117 & 5 \\
		\hline
		\vdots & \vdots \\
		n & 13\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}

	We can add to pointers just like we can add to integers. It functions slightly differently for reasons that well expand on shortly, but consider in our current diagram we can access every element of our array, by adding its index in the array to $A$ and dereferencing the result like so {\it *(A+i)}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Operations: Addition (+)}
	Lets explore some code to confirm this is how it works.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int A[5] = {6,7,8,9,10};

printf("Val of base pointer A = 0x%x\n", A);

printf("________________________________________________________\n");
for(int i=0; i < 5; i++){
	printf("*(A+%d) = %d | ", i, *(A+i));
	printf("A[%d] = %d | ", i, A[i]);
	printf("Address of value at (A+%d) = 0x%x\n", i, (A+i));
}
\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pointer Operations: Addition (+)}
Our output should look something like, only the values of $(A+i)$ will differ.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
Val of base pointer A = 0x388e5690
______________________________________________________________
*(A+0) = 6 | A[0] = 6 | Address of value at (A+0) = 0x388e5690
*(A+1) = 7 | A[1] = 7 | Address of value at (A+1) = 0x388e5694
*(A+2) = 8 | A[2] = 8 | Address of value at (A+2) = 0x388e5698
*(A+3) = 9 | A[3] = 9 | Address of value at (A+3) = 0x388e569c
*(A+4) = 10 | A[4] = 10 | Address of value at (A+4) = 0x388e56a0
\end{minted}
Everything seems to make sense, dereferencing $(A+i)$ gets us the ith element same as $A[i]$, but look at how $(A+i)$ increases in value. It increments by 4 each time instead of 1, like our current memory model would cause us to expect.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The type system}
To understand why this happens we need to understand a little bit about the type system and the sizes of different types.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The atomic unit of memory in C is the {\bf byte} (8 bits).
	\item Each type in C takes up a certain amount of {\bf bytes} of memory.
	\item The function {\it sizeof()} takes either a type or variable as an argument.
	\item Given a type {\it sizeof()} returns the size of the type in bytes, and given a variable it returns the size of the type of the variable in bytes. It does {\bf not} return the size of an array. Given an array it will just return the size of the type which is a pointer.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The type system}
Lets look at the size of some types. Please be aware that sizes may be different on different hardware platforms, so these may not be same on your system.

\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
printf("Size of integer = %lu\n", sizeof(int));                             //prints 4 (4 bytes = 32 bits)
printf("Size of long integer = %lu\n", sizeof(long int));                   //prints 8
printf("Size of unsigned long integer = %lu\n", sizeof(unsigned long int)); //prints 8
printf("Size of size_t = %lu\n", sizeof(size_t));                           //prints 8
printf("Size of char = %lu\n", sizeof(char));                               //prints 1
//these will all print 8
printf("Size of int* = %lu\n", sizeof(int*));
printf("Size of char* = %lu\n", sizeof(char*));
\end{minted}
Observe that an integer is 4 bytes, also that all pointers are the same size. Again pointers are just numbers, specifically in C they are unsigned 64 bit integers. Thus all pointers regardless of type have the same size of 8 bytes.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The type system}
{\bf Output}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
Size of integer = 4
Size of long integer = 8
Size of unsigned long integer = 8
Size of size_t = 8
Size of char = 1
Size of int* = 8
Size of char* = 8
\end{minted}
Observe that an integer is 4 bytes, also that all pointers are the same size. Again pointers are just numbers, specifically in C they are unsigned 64 bit integers. Thus all pointers regardless of type have the same size of 8 bytes.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Adding to a pointer revisited}
Now lets look more closely at adding to a pointer with a code example.

\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int* i=0;
int j=0;

printf("Value of Int ptr: 0x%x\n",i);
printf("Value of Int: 0x%x\n",j);

i += 2; //increment ptr
j += 2*sizeof(int); //increment integer

printf("Value of Int ptr: 0x%x\n",i);
printf("Value of Int: 0x%x\n",j);
\end{minted}
{\bf Output}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
Value of Int ptr: 0
Value of Int: 0
Value of Int ptr: 8
Value of Int: 8
\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Adding to a pointer revisited}
Now lets be clear about how pointer addition is actually defined. If a pointer $i$ is equivalent to a number $j$ then adding to $i$ is equivalent to adding the same thing to $j$ times the size of the type that $i$ points to.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $int* i = j$
	\item $i + 1 \iff j + 1 * sizeof(int)$
	\item More generally $i + x \iff j + x * sizeof(int)$
\end{enumerate}
This is why the array pointer $A$ increased in increments of 4 since that is the size of the {\bf int} data type. Lets redraw our array to make this more clear.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Allocating Memory From the Heap}
We want to use pointers for our own structures that we can control. For that we need memory to store those structures, to get said memory we must request it from the operating system. For this we use {\it malloc}.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
malloc( size_t size)
\end{minted}
malloc is a simple function. It takes a whole number size to denote the number of bytes you want, and it returns a pointer to said number of bytes on the heap.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Allocating Memory From the Heap}
Heres how we can allocate space for a single variable.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int* i = malloc( sizeof(int) );
\end{minted} 
It is important to always allocate the appropriate amount of bytes for the type your pointer is pointing to, for this reason using {\it sizeof(type)} is best practice when using malloc.\\

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Allocating Memory From the Heap}
It should also be noted that malloc when given a pointer such as $i$, does not return the amount of bytes allocated to $i$ it returns the size of the type of $i$ in bytes. In this case since $i$ is a pointer it would return 8.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int* i = malloc( sizeof(i) ); //i points to 8 bytes
\end{minted} 
If you were to dereference $i$ then you would get the size of the type that $i$ points.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int* i = malloc( sizeof(*i) ); //i points to 4 bytes
\end{minted} 

Lets clear up these differences with a code example.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
    int *i;
    printf("sizeof i: %d sizeof *i: %d\n", sizeof(i), sizeof(*i));
\end{minted} 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Allocating Arrays and Structs}
Arrays are just contiguous memory locations, so to allocate space for an array we just need to request enough space for all the items we would like to store.
The 2 declarations below are equivalent in that they both gives us arrays that store the same amount of elements.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int A[5]; //array of 5 ints
int *B = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5); //pointer to 5 ints
\end{minted}
They are not equivalent in that we cannot later change the size of the array $A$, but we can for $B$. Also recall the $A$ is stored on the stack, and $B$ is stored on the heap.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Allocating Arrays and Structs}
Structures are a data type in C that allow you to store multiple items of different data types together. We can declare a struct like so.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
struct person {
	char* name;
	int age;
	int height;
};
\end{minted}
Here the variables name, age, and height would be called "members" of the person struct. We can declare a struct and access its members like so.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
struct person p;
p.age = 5;
printf("%d\n", p.age);
\end{minted}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Allocating Arrays and Structs}
For reasons we'll discuss later you usually want to use pointers to structs, not structs themselves. It is far more expensive to pass a struct as an argument to function instead of pointer to a struct. It is common to use C's typedef operator when declaring structs to avoid having to type struct every time you reference it. Using this idom our person struct becomes. 

\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
typedef struct{
	char* name;
	int age;
	int height;
}person;
\end{minted}
We can declare a pointer to a person and allocate space for it the same way we would for any other type.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
person* p = malloc(sizeof(person));
\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Allocating Arrays and Structs}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
person* p = malloc(sizeof(person));
(*p).age = 5;
printf("%d\n", (*p).age);
\end{minted}
To access its members we could dereference and use dot notation, but due to operator precedence we have to use parentheses which makes this rather awkward. We can instead use arrow notation to access the members of a struct pointer.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
p->age = 5;
printf("%d\n", p->age);
\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Allocating Arrays and Structs}
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
typedef struct{
	char* name;
	int age;
	int height;
}person;

int main(){
	person* p = malloc(sizeof(person));
}
\end{minted}
Just because we have allocated space for the struct does that mean we have allocated any space for the {\it char* name}? No. We have allocated 8 bytes for the pointer that is {\it name}, but it does not have space on the heap to store any data.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Free}
In the same the compiler reclaims static memory when variables fall out of scope, etc, we must reclaim memory we allocate from the heap so that it can be reused by out program. We do this with the {\it free} function.

\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
void free(void *ptr);
\end{minted}

To free a variable or an array we simply pass {\it free} the pointer.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
int *B = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5); //pointer to 5 ints
free(B); //that heap memory can be reused
\end{minted}
You must free everything you allocate. If you fail to do so it is called a memory leak. If you program continually allocates memory and never reclaims it, it is destined to crash.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Freeing Struct Pointers} 
When you have pointers to structs that themselves contain pointers the process of reclaiming memory can be a bit complicated. Consider our person struct from before.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
typedef struct{
	char* name;
	int age;
	int height;
}person;

int main(){
	person* p = malloc(sizeof(person));
	p->name = malloc(sizeof(char) * 5);
}
\end{minted}
If we simply $free(p)$, then we have lost the location of the memory allocated to $p->name$. We must free any pointer that a struct has before freeing it.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Freeing Struct Pointers} 
The appropriate way to free the person struct containing pointers.
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
person* p = malloc(sizeof(person));

p->name = malloc(sizeof(char) * 5);

free(p->name);

free(p);
\end{minted}
\end{frame}
