### Memory Structure
- Stack vs heap (malloc)
- Dynamic vs static 

### Pointers
- Memory as a table with indices and values, pointers hold the value of an index. Dereference gets the value at that index.
- Operations
  - address of  (&)
  - dereference (*)
  - addition    (+) jump into arrays as pointers

### Memory Management
- malloc a single value
- malloc an array
- malloc a struct
- freeing your memory

### Dynamic Array programming example

### Pass by reference vs pass by value
- Everything is really pass by value (why can you modify a pointer in a function with out disturbing the original)

### Enviroment Setup 
- VSCode remote development (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)
